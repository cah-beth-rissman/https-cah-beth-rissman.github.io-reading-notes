# Change Your Words, Change Your Mindset
## *Growth Mindset Explained*
  > *There are two main mindsets we can navigate life with: **growth and fixed**. A fixed mindset is typical in someone that is incapable of change, has a preference for stability and consistency. Making little or no effort to grow their intellectual abilities or talents. Someone with a growth mindset has the capacity to tackle new challenges, learn new things and expand their intelligence over time.* <br>- Beth Rissman
